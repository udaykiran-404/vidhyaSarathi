# VidhyaSarathi – Aptitude-Based Career & Stream Explorer

VidhyaSarathi is a career guidance prototype that helps students **explore academic streams based on aptitude**, not just interest or marks.

Unlike traditional career guidance systems that only *recommend* streams, VidhyaSarathi focuses on **Stream Exploration** by allowing students to **experience realistic scenarios** from different streams before making a decision.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Many students choose academic streams based on:
- Peer pressure
- Marks alone
- Limited awareness of what a stream actually involves

This often leads to:
- Mismatch between student abilities and chosen stream
- Stress, lack of motivation, and dropouts

VidhyaSarathi addresses this gap by combining **aptitude evaluation** with **scenario-based exploration**.

## 💡 What Makes This Project Unique

✔ Focuses on *experience*, not just advice  
✔ Uses **aptitude data**, not preferences alone  
✔ Generates **AI-powered stream scenarios**    
✔ Designed for **students, parents, and educators**  

> The goal is not to tell students *what to choose*, but to help them *understand what they are choosing*.
